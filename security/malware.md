Unit 8

## Spyware
* Adware
  * find out about your browsing history and your downloads
  * then displays advertisements tailored to your history
  * tries to entice you to make a purchaseAdware
  * Too much adware in your system can seriously slow your machine down

* Trojan
  * Within other code
  * Manual or automatic. Often with some user authorization
    * Downloads from untrusted sources
    * Pirate software
    * USB flash drives
    * Self-replicating: some are, many aren’t.
* Tracking Cookies
  * track your web activities, such as searches, history and downloads for marketing purposes
  * This can result in you receiving an increased number of targeted advertising attempts
  * They can take up a huge amount of space in your system
* System Monitors
  * capture virtually anything you do on your computer
  * record keystrokes, emails, chat-room dialogues, websites visited, programs run by you
  * These are sometimes disguised as freeware

## Warm
* a program that copies itself from one computer to another.
* distinction with `virus’, virus does not need to move between machines
* All worms are viruses, but not all viruses are worms

## Crypto-jacking
* unauthorised use of your computer system to mine for crypto-currency
* This can seriously reduce the capability of your computer to work for you
* It can consume huge amounts of additional power at your expense

## Polymorphic Viruses 時間でかわる？
* A polymorphic virus changes form over time, typically each time it inserts itself into a new program.

## Detection
#### Signature-based (a form of blacklisting)
* Look for patterns in code related to previously seen malware
* Look for exact same hash of file as known malware
* Look for the same, or similar-looking, code fragments (e.g. polymorphic decryptor components below) or hashes thereof
* Pros
  * Fast and reliable, when it works
  * Filters all the basics.
* Cons
  * Backwards-facing
  * Fails on new malware
  * Struggles with good polymorphic code. 
  * Needs access to up-to-date database of signatures

#### Anomaly-based
* Look for unusual behaviour (e.g. traffic generated, improper attempts to access). 
* Pros
  * Can catch new (zero-day) malware, not previously seen, including polymorphic variants.
  * Can halt attacks or alert as they happen.
* Cons
  * Slow. Attacks in the wild get started, and propagation may be fast. 
  * Need to emulate in sandbox first in order to prevent attacks in advance – often not practicable.
